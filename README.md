# A Collection of CadQuery Projects
A collection of scripts from my own [CadQuery](https://dcowden.github.io/cadquery/intro.html) projects and experiments.

You are welcome to reference these scripts, but be aware that they can be rearranged and refactored at any time. They are also not guaranteed to be technically correct, and some scripts may end up being perpetually "in progress".
