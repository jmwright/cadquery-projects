## Assembly Example

If you are interested in doing assemblies using CadQuery, please do not use this example as a guide. The [cqparts](https://github.com/fragmuffin/cqparts) library is built on top of CadQuery and is much better suited to handling both parts and assemblies.

If you are just interested in creating assemblies with FreeCAD, please have a look at the [assembly2 workbench](https://github.com/hamish2014/FreeCAD_assembly2) available in the addons manager in FreeCAD 0.17+.
